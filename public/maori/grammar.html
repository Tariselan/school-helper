                        <h4>Definite Phrases</h4>
                        <p>Definite phrases and sentences are indicated by the particle <strong>Ko</strong>.</p>
                        <p>A definite phrase indicates something/someone we are referring to specifically. For example: The boy, as opposed to A boy. In this example, we are referring to someone in particular (the boy), as opposed to a non-specified boy (a boy). <strong>Ko</strong> is specific.</p>
                        <p>A definite phrase may also contain what we refer to as 'definite articles' <em>te</em> and <em>ngā</em>. <em>Te</em> is the Māori word for 'the - singular' and <em>ngā</em> is the Māori word for 'the - plural' (see example below).</p>
                        <ul class="example-list">
                            <li><strong>Ko te ngeru.</strong><br>The cat. (singular - 1 cat)</li>
                            <li><strong>Ko ngā ngeru.</strong><br>The cats. (plural - more than 1 cat)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Equative Sentences (Definite Sentences)</h4>
                        <p>An equative sentence (also called definite) consists of a definite phrase and a subject, for example:</p>
                        <p>Definite phrase + Subject</p>
                        <ul class="example-list">
                            <li><strong>Ko te ngeru</strong> + tērā.<br>That is the cat. (singular - 1 cat)</li>
                            <li><strong>Ko ngā ngeru</strong> + ērā.<br>Those are the cats. (plural - more than 1 cat)</li>
                            <li><strong>Ko ia</strong> + te kaiako.<br>He is the teacher.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ko tēnei whare</strong> + te whare o Hone.<br>This house is Hone's house.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Indefinite Phrases</h4>
                        <p>Indefinite phrases and sentences are indicated by the word <strong>He</strong>.</p>
                        <p><strong>Indefinite Phrases:</strong><br>
                        <strong>He</strong> + noun.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul class="example-list">
                            <li><strong>He kiore.</strong><br>A rat (or some rats).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Contrast this with the following definite phrases in which we know specifically which rat or rats we are talking about:</p>
                        <ul class="example-list">
                            <li><strong>Ko te kiore.</strong><br>The rat.</li>
                            <li><strong>Ko ngā kiore.</strong><br>The rats.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Classifying Sentences</h4>
                        <p><strong>He</strong> + noun / adjective + subject.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul class="example-list">
                            <li><strong>He pukapuka tenei.</strong><br>This is a book.</li>
                            <li><strong>He wahine ia.</strong><br>She is a woman.</li>
                            <li><strong>He māhana tēnei waina.</strong><br>This wine is warm.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h3>Active Sentences</h3>
                    <div class="explanation">
                        <p>Active sentences are constructed using the following form:</p>
                        <p><strong>Tense</strong> + verb + subject + i/ki + object.</p>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <ul class="example-list">
                            <li><strong>Kei te haere au ki te hui.</strong><br>I am going to the meeting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In English, the form of the verb changes depending on the tense, for example, go, going, went, etc. In Māori, only the tense marker changes; the verb always stays the same. Take, for example, the verb <em>haere</em>, which means "go".</p>

                            <li><em>e (verb) ana</em> - continuous tense: This tense is called a continuous tense because it can denote a verb-ing word in any tense.</li>
                            <li><em>Ka</em> - future tense or next action: <em>Ka</em> is not limited to indicating future action; it can also be used to indicate that something happens next.</li>

                    <h3>Passive Sentences</h3>
                    <div class="explanation">
                        <p>Within active sentences, the focus is on the agent (whoever or whatever is doing the verb), however, passive sentences focus on the patient of the verb (the receiver of the action). Passive sentences change the focus to whoever or whatever is affected by the verb (the patient).</p>
                        <p>Following is an example of the construction of a passive sentence. Note that passive sentences use the same tense markers as active sentences.</p>
                        <p><strong>Tense</strong> + verb(passivised) + patient + e + agent</p>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="example-list">
                            <li><strong>Kua hangaia te marae e ngā tohunga.</strong><br>The marae has been built by the experts.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Compare this with the active form:</p>
                        <ul class="example-list">
                            <li><strong>Kua hanga ngā tohunga i te marae.</strong><br>The experts have built the marae.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Notice the differences which take place:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>There is a 'tail' or passive ending on the verb.</li>
                            <li>The direct object marker 'i' has been deleted.</li>
                            <li>The word e comes before the agent.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There are special affixes or 'tails' which go on the ends of verbs in passive sentences. These 'tails' depend on which verb you use.</p>

                        <p>Not all verbs have a passive form.</p>
                        <p>Passive sentences are used much more frequently in Māori. Note that in the examples above, the English translations may sometimes seem unnatural; therefore, it is sometimes best to switch between passive and active when translating between Māori and English.</p>

                    <div class="explanation">
                        <p>The Agent Emphatic emphasises the agent as the doer of the verb. It is only used for past tense and future tense sentences.</p>
                        <p>The formulas are as follows:</p>
                        <p><strong>Past tense:</strong><br>
                        Nā + agent + subject + i + verb<br>

                        <strong>Nā te kōtiro te taramu i patu.</strong><br>
                        It was the girl who hit the drum.<br>
                        <em>or with spoken emphasis:</em><br>
                        The girl hit the drum.</p>

                        It will be the girl who will hit the drum.<br>

                    <div class="explanation">
                        <p>A locative phrase describes the location of something in place or time.</p>
                        <p>Kei roto ngā rākau i te wao. (There are trees in the forest.)</p>
                        <p>The basic formula for a locative phrase is:</p>
                        <p>Preposition + location/locative noun + subject + i + place.</p>
                        <p>In the above example:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Preposition = Kei (present tense)</li>
                            <li>Locative noun = roto (in)</li>
                            <li>Subject = ngā rākau (the trees)</li>
                            <li>Preposition = i</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>As well as 'Kei', there are two other locative tense markers - 'I' (past) and 'Hei' (future).</p>

                        <h4>Passive</h4>
                        <p>A passive sentence follows the same form, for example,</p>
                        <p>I hangaia te whare e Bob. (The house was built by Bob.)</p>
                        <p>Kāore te whare i hangaia e Bob. (The house was not built by Bob.)</p>
                        <h4>Locative sentences</h4>
                        <p>A locative sentence, no matter what the tense, is always negated using 'i', for example,</p>
                        <p>Kei runga te pene i te tēpu. (The pen is on the table.)</p>
                        <p>Kāore te pene i runga i te tēpu. (The pen is not, was not, will not be... on the table.)</p>
                        <p>Note that a locative phrase as part of an active sentence follows the active sentence rules above, for example,</p>
                        <p>Ka moe au ki tātahi. (I will sleep at the beach.)</p>
                        <p>Kāore au e moe ki tātahi. (I will not sleep at the beach.)</p>
                        <h4>The Agent Emphatic</h4>
                        <p>Agent emphatic sentences can be negated by simply prefixing them with Ehara, for example:</p>
                        <p>Nā rātou te whare i hanga. (They built the house.)</p>
                        <p>Ehara nā rātou te whare i hanga. (They didn't build the house.)</p>
                        <p>Agent emphatic sentences may also be negated as follows:</p>
                        <p>Ehara i a rātou te whare i hanga. (They didn't build the house.)</p>
                        <h4>Do not - Kaua e</h4>
                        <p>Patua te taramu! (Hit the drum!)</p>

                        <p>Explanation of command sentences...</p>
                        <h4>Simple active form</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Haere mai! - Come here!</li>
                            <li>E noho! - Sit!</li>
                            <li>E tū! - Stand!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note that 'E' precedes the verb if it contains 2 short vowels or fewer. It also occurs before numbers 2-9 in certain contexts (see numbers).</p>
                        <p>The active form of the verb is also used where an object is specified and the appropriate preposition is 'ki'.</p>
                        <p>Example: Whakarongo ki ngā whaea! - Listen to the aunties!</p>
                        <h4>Simple passive form</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Patua te pōro! - Hit the ball!</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>The passive form is used where the person commanded is to act on a thing, and which in an active sentence would take 'i' rather than 'ki'.</p>
                        <h4>Me - Should</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Me haere koe ki te kāinga! - You should go home!</li>
                            <li>Me whakarongo koe ki tōu whaea! - You should listen to your aunty!</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Note that the passive form of a verb is never used after Me even though it may be used in a passive sense.</p>

                            <li>Kia tūpato te tapahi! - Cut carefully!</li>

                            <li>Ka haere tāua ki te toa! - Let's go to the shop! (2 people including the speaker)</li>

                        </ul>

                            <li>Taihoa e oma! - Don't run yet.</li>
