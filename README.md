aloha! i am leilani and i will walk you (likely future me) on how to install this silly litte project

# 1. Download!
You probably figured this one out but pretty pls just DOWNLOAD THE FILES

# 2. Depencies!
Okay now we install the dependencies (if this is a new device, make sure you have the a recent version of **node.js** installed)

```bash
npm install sqlite3
```

# 3. Running the program!
Open up the folder inside your favourite IDE or just navigate there via your command prompt, console, or terminal. Then run:
 ```bash
 node app.js
 ```

The terminal should then say:
```bash
Te motu, kei te wāhi 3001 te motu
```

Which is Māori for, "The island, the island is at the place 3001" AKA just a really shittily done vaguely metaphoric translation of "the program is being run on port 3001". 
Feel free to change the port its running on. My fav to use are 3000, 3001, 300X, 30XX, and 3023 (23 is my fav number :3).
